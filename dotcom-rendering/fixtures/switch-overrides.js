/**
 * üôè Only put GLOBAL overrides here üôè
 *
 * Any swtich key value entered here will be used by ALL tests (jest,
 * Storybook, Cypress, etc.) and could cause confusing side effects.
 *
 * If you need to override a value for a specific test please consider doing this
 * locally using a spread operator. Eg.:
 *
 * import { Article as Original } from '/fixtures/automatic/articles/Article';
 *
 * const MyArticle = {
 *   ...Original,
 * 	 config: {
 *     ...Original.config
 *     switches: {
 *       ...Original.config.switches,
 *       mySwitch: true,
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * If you still think you need a global override please add a comment explaining
 * why, thanks!
